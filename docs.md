## Making your passion long time 

Itâ€™s like being a professional athlete.

You need to be prepared to do the hours. You need to practice. You need to do all this for free. With no financial gain.

At a certain point you get your opportunity to do something bigger. So you can put your skills to the test.

The ones that become the best are the ones that dedicate more hours that their competitor.
